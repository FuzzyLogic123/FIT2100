Task 1.2

a)
absolute paths begin with the ~ character or the slash character

Absolute
Relative
Absolute
Relative
Relative
Relative
absolute

b)
Relative paths are useful is you were to change the location of a folder, but all then folders within that one will still be accessible because they are relative to the parent folder. Absolute paths are useful because you can access a file from no matter what directory you are in.

c)

cd ~/../

cd .

d)
This means that it looks to the top of the current directory and then selects a file from there, all files must be accessed from a certain file path, specifying simply the name does not demonstrate the actual location of the file. If trying to run a file without using ./ at the beginning, the correct file would not run.

Task 2

a)
Because the one with -g has included the debugging information within the executable

b)
Line number 6, column 19

c)
With -g (debugger included) it shows the name of the file and the line of the file. Without debugger information it just mentions the absolute path of the executable.

d)
The program is trying to accept a string entered by the user and then print that to the user. The program is incorrect because it has initialised the variable for the string as a character. It is trying to assign a multi-character string to a string.
