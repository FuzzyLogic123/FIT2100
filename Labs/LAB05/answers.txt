Task 1
	a) yes
	2, 1, 4, 3
	b) no
	the smallest gap is 20 bytes of memory, and therefore it is impossible to avoid a deadlock

Task 2)
	see attached image file

Task 3)
	Mutual exclusion: No two cars can occupy the same area in the lane in the intersection, use traffic lights. They are using a shared resource.

	Hold and wait: cars occupy the space that they are present in
	No preemption: cars can only go if the entire lane next to them is clear. Two processes canâ€™t run at once
	Circular wait: each car is waiting for the car on their left. They are waiting on resources from the next car.

Task 4)
	detection: call traffic controller
	avoidance: tunnel, bridge
	prevention: traffic lights, round about
